      <p>This website has been up for a few months now, but I haven't finished setting up the post system until now. It's just raw HTML and CSS, good old Web 1.0. It's definitely not the best or easiest way to create a website, but it's fun in it's own way.</p>
      <p>In the future, I hope to use this site as a blog to talk about my thought process for my current/future projects and my general opinions on random interests.</p>
